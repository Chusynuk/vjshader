# Dependecies
- [ofxShader](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/ofxShader)
- ofxGui [included with openFrameworks]

*You do not need to use ofxShader, you can use ofShader if you really want to. You don't even have to use ofxGui if you want, but it does help in sending signals around*

# What is this?

A VJ shader application that uses some really nice & simple tricks to get an effective result.

It is a barebones VJ application that also uses GLSL as its main graphics. Whilst simple, it can be extended & built upon to create some really interesting works.<br>Born from work I had done for a band, for a mini tour. Playing several shows & having the graphics project onto the band. It was great fun üëç

This project has 2 screens.<br>One is a settings window, the other is for projecting what you have setup in the settings window.<br>Whether that be a second screen or projector.<br>The settings window stores, well, settings to then send & affect the GLSL graphics in the second screen. Once we are happy with these settings, we can then send it to the main projection window, letting the public see our awesome graphics.

# Competition

Until the 24th May 2020, there is a competition for people to edit this VJ application & create something really interesting, using the things we had learned thru the [openFrameworks tutorial series](https://github.com/lewislepton/openFrameworksTutorialSeries).<br>Please watch the video above & follow the instructions.

Winners will be posted on here, so people can get to see the really nice things they have made using this barebones application

Have ph√ºn & enjoy making cool things

Your application is your application. Your code is your code & it will stay that way. I do not take credit for your creations. I wanted to do this competition as something fun that we can participate in & learn some new things along the way üòÑ
