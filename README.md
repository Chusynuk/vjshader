A VJ shader application that uses some really nice & simple tricks to get an effective result.

This project has 2 screens.<br>One is a settings window, the other is for projecting what you have setup in the settings window.<br>Whether that be a secend screen or projector

Until the 24th May 2020, there is a competition for people to edit this VJ application & create something really interesting, using the things we had learned thru the [openFrameworks tutorial series](https://github.com/lewislepton/openFrameworksTutorialSeries).<br>Please watch the video above & follow the instructions.

Winners will be posted on here, so people can get to see the really nice things they have made
